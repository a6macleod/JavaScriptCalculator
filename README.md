# JavaScriptCalculator
JavaScript Calculator


This project is from The Odin Project (https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/calculator?ref=lnav)

My goals for this project are to create a functional calculator using only HTML, CSS, and javaScript.

This project was a great challenge to continue developing my javascript skills. I also used this project to continue learning git and experiment with branching, and reverting to earlier versions.
